<h3>I'm creating my first website!</h3>
<h4>The Idea</h4>
<p>The plan is to create a portfolio website for my photography business, this will be a 4/5 page website with sections such as: Home, about, services, portfolio and contact. To create this site I will use html, css and javascript + whatever else is required.<br> Main features I would like the site to have is:<br><br>
* A dynamic photo library (Click on main photo which takes you to the collection and includes a description)<br>
* Links to social media and embedded instagram feed<br>
*
